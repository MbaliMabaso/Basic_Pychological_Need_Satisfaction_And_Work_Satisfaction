1️⃣ Overview
This project is based on my Master's thesis, which explored the predictors of **work satisfaction** using **Self-Determination Theory (SDT)**. The study involved **survey validation** through **Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)** and **structural equation modeling**, achieving **68% variance explained** in work satisfaction.

2️⃣ Research Question
How do **autonomy, competence, and relatedness**—core components of SDT—predict work satisfaction?

3️⃣ Dataset
- **Source:** Survey data collected for my Master's thesis
- **Sample Size:** [(N = 602,69% men), aged 19-66]
- **Variables:** Work satisfaction, autonomy, competence, relatedness.

  4️⃣  Methodology
1. **Survey Validation with CFA**
   - Used IBM Amos  to test the **construct validity** of survey items
   - Established **configural and metric invariance**
  
2. **Structural Equation Modeling**
   - Examined the relationship between SDT variables and work satisfaction

3. **Comparison to a Non-Validated Approach (Work-Satisfaction-Analysis)*
   - Highlighted the impact of **survey quality** on model accuracy
   - Demonstrated the importance of **validating survey instruments** in predictive modeling

5️⃣  Results
- **Validated Model (Master’s Thesis):** 68% variance explained
- **Non-Validated Model:** 23% variance explained
- **Key Finding:** Survey validation significantly improves the **reliability and explanatory power** of predictive models

  6️⃣ Tools & Technologies
- IBM Amos and SPSS
- Tableau (for data visualization)
- Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)
- Structural equation modeling
- Regression Analysis

  7️⃣ Key Takeaways
✅ **Survey validation improves model accuracy**
✅ **Theoretical frameworks enhance predictive power**
✅ **Data science in organizational psychology can provide actionable insights**
